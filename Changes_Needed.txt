TODO
1)Resolve initiative ties. DONE
SOLUTION:
Allow DM to use decimal places when inputting initiative rolls.

2)Change "add" command to take place in initiative list instead of initiative value to solve bugs. DONE
    PROBLEM: sort will not work after adding new combatants unless a way to give them meaningful initiative values is found.
    SOLUTION 1: Ignore it. You shouldn't be sorting after combat has started anyway. DONE
    SOLUTION 2:
        Give added combatants meaningful initiative values
            implement the true initiative list that holds what the combatant list will be at the start of every round
            tell every combatant their place in this list
            when inserting added combatant,
            if in middle,
                give combatant initiative value equal to average of initiative values of combatants before and after them in true initiative list
                retell combatants their place in the list
            if in front,
                give combatant an initiative value equal to initiative value of the 1st combatant in the true initiative list +1
            if in back
                give combatant an initiative value equal to  initiative value of the last combatant in the true initiative list -1
            Reassign combatants' places in list after inserting new combatant
                PROBLEM: DM will tell Tracker where to insert in combatant list, not true initiative list. How to add to true initiative list?
                SOLUTION:
                    Insert new combatant into combatant list
                    Get combatant in front of or behind added combatant depending on where it was added in the combatant list (for back or middle, use in front of. for front, sue behind)
                    Find that combatant in the true initiative list
                    Insert before or after that combatant depending on how it was added in the combatant list

3) Resolve duplicate names DONE
SOLUTION: DONE
create dictionary to hold all combatants
when adding combatant at any time, check for name in dictionary
if name exists
    create a temp version of the name
    add a number to it (start at 2)
    repeat check again
    if name exists again, use next number and repeat
Once unique name is found, assign to combatant and add to dictionary and list


4) Handle Temporary Hit Points more robustly
    SOLUTION:
    have temporary hit points be separate category
    subtract from temporary HP before normal HP
    heal only applies to normal HP
    add new command "give temp HP [name] [amount]"
        gives temporary hitpoints equal to the new amount if it is greater than current temp hit points (per DnD rules, temp hit points do not stack)

Last) Fix BUGS
BUG:
changing initiative of first combatant effectively gives that combatant an extra turn, as the change takes place during the current round instead of the next round
names of characters added after combat has started are in all lower case
SOLUTION: DONE
    Change the way change_init works. Instead of asking for the new initiative value for a combatant, ask new place place in the combatant list.
    Assign a meaningful initiative value yourself.
    Stop displaying initiative value to DM

BUG:
changing the initiative of any combatant to one that is higher than that of current combatant effectively ends the current combatant's turn and changes it to
the other combatant's turn.
Current combatant is now second in list and gets second turn.
SOLUTION: DONE
    See solution to above BUG


Questions for Kyle:
1) What happens when a combatant's initiative is changed to be higher than that of the current combatant?
2) Will scenario from (1) ever happen? (Brandon thinks: Yes. A homebrew spell/attack from NPC could change initiative of another combatant)
