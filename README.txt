Hello User!

You actually took the time to look at this README. Good for you! Most people don't.
DnD Combat Tracker allows you to track a large amount of combatants in the popular
table top game Dungeons & Dragons (5e), giving you control over their HP, AC, and Initiative.
You can also add and remove combatants as needed. It will also keep track of whose
turn it is for you. All you have to do is type "next" to tell it the current combatant's
turn is over. For a detailed list of commands, just type "help" while the program is running.

If you want information on how to use any of the commands, just type "help"
while the program is running. It will give you a list of commands and their arguments
in brackets. You should NOT type the arguments in brackets when typing the command into
the program. Generally, they are of this form: command [name] [amount]

That's about it. It's a pretty simple but useful tool. Thanks for using my program
and reading the README.

Best Regards,
Brandon Lyday

P.S. Don't worry about any sort of license agreement crap. Just have fun with this.
Try to hack it if you want to. And feel free to share this with others. I'm keeping it
totally free. All I ask is that you give credit where credit is due and don't say you
made this.

P.P.S. I included an icon in the distibution that you can use for desktop shortcuts if
you think the default icon is ugly (I sure do). If you want to use it, make a desktop
shortcut for "DnD Combat Tracker.exe" file. Then right-click the shortcut, click
Properties, then click the Change Icon button. Click the "Browse" button, then go to
wherever you saved the program folder to. Select the "dnd_dragon_icon.ico" file then
click the Open button. Click the Okay buttons until you're done.
Sorry that I don't know how to make this happen automatically.
